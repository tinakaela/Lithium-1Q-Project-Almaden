                <p>Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense as rising temperatures dry out forests and soils, exacerbating the problem.
                When trees burn, they release carbon that has been stored for decades. This turns forests from carbon sinks into carbon sources, which fuels even more warming.
                Additionally, terrestrial ecosystems affect how much solar energy is absorbed by land and exchange greenhouse gases with the atmosphere. 
                Scientists estimate their feedback could add up to 1.5 °C more warming by 2100 (Meir, Cox, & Grace, 2006).
                As our planet warms, ice melts, seas rise, storms intensify, and heat waves grow deadlier, entire regions could become uninhabitable. This results to mass migrations and collapsing food systems, 
                risking countless species. If we continue on this destructive path, the crisis will no longer be confined to nature — it will define our lives.</p>

            <h1>Displaced Wildlife: Vanishing Habitats</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="section3">
                <p>Animals are on the brink of extinction due to climate change.
                They are losing their homes as rising temperatures shift vegetation, water sources, and food supplies — forcing them to migrate or die off. 
                For example, polar bears are stranded on land as sea ice melts, and Africa's elephants could disappear within 40 years if habitat loss and warming continue (WWF, 2015). 
                As habitats continue to collapse, over one million species are now at risk of extinction.
                In addition, these forced migrations also drive wildlife closer to human communities, often leading to conflict and retaliatory killings. 
                As habitats vanish, so do the species that maintain our ecosystems — from the pollinators that grow our food to the predators that keep the balance of nature. 
                Without them, our planet's web of life will start to unravel.</p>

                <p>Droughts, heatwaves, and pests are weakening and killing trees, while soil dries and erodes.
                These ecosystem changes reduce biodiversity and weaken nature's ability to absorb carbon dioxide — worsening global warming.
                Moreover, the terrestrial carbon cycle strongly influences Earth's climate, but our understanding of it is still limited (Meir, Cox, & Grace, 2006).
                Unlike the sudden destruction caused by wildfires, this slow decline is invisible — until it's too late. 
                As forest canopies thin, the land becomes hotter and drier, accelerating soil loss and pushing species toward extinction. 
                If these forests collapse, they may never return, and with them will go one of Earth's strongest defenses against climate change.</p>

            <h1>Polluting Our Way to Collapse</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="section5">
                <p>Air pollution from burning fossil fuels increases greenhouse gases, trapping heat in the atmosphere. 
                Additionally, land and water pollution damage soil, plants, and aquatic life — weakening the ecosystems that naturally store carbon and support biodiversity.
                Pollution feeds the very crisis it creates: poisoned soils can't grow life, polluted water kills aquatic ecosystems, and smog blocks sunlight needed for plants to thrive.
                 As these natural systems break down, Earth loses its ability to absorb carbon. This allows global temperatures to rise even faster.</p>

                <p>There is no Planet B. Protecting ecosystems is a societal necessity. Responsibility doesn't lie on one person; it's on all of us.
                Every action matters. Supporting renewable energy, reducing waste, protecting habitats, and amplifying the voices of communities on the frontlines of climate change all contribute to building a safer future. 
                Through our choices, we can defend the life that sustains us all. The world will not change — until we choose to.</p>
